In publishing, the _colophon_ is a statement usually found at the end of a book or document containing facts about its production.

This site has been online since 2001. The domain was a gift from [my dad](http://rudy.ca), and it was a playground and learning vehicle that took many forms in those early years of blogging, web standards, and open sharing. I miss that web.

Then various things in both the tech industry and my life happened, as they are wont to do, and it was parked with a simple placeholder while I went through the cycle of rebuilding this site but never actually launching it more times than I care to admit. Well, flush with wisdom and renewed aspirations, here we are again.

## Technical details

If you're interested, some of this current iteration's underpinnings:

- It's built with the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator, the [base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) starter template, and some plugins for typographic niceties.
- The site design is certainly not earth-shatteringly novel, and inspired by countless others with a similar aesthetic. It will evolve, but I want to focus on writing and shipping (which I struggle with) and not fancy pixels (which I am prone to fiddling endlessly with).
- Pages are styled with hand-written vanilla CSS, which Eleventy neatly concatenates and minimizes.
- This site respects the light/dark mode you have set on your device. Maybe my eyes are getting old and tired, but sites that blast a white background at me when I have dark mode on are rude.
- What typeface you're seeing depends on your device, as I use [system fonts](https://modernfontstacks.com/) that are built into your operating system.
- This site does not track you or contain any analytics reporting at all. In fact, it doesn't use JavaScript anywhere in the pages you're viewing.
- If you're an RSS person, here's an [XML](/feed/feed.xml) or [JSON](/feed/feed.json) feed.
- The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dlimeb/dlimeb.github.io), which upon updating `main` automatically deploys to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting.
