description: Technical details about this site
---

This site has been online since 2001. The domain was a gift from [my dad](http://rudy.ca), and it was a playground that took many forms in those early years of blogging, web standards, and open sharing. I miss that web.

Then various things in both the tech industry and my life happened, as they are wont to do, and it was a simple placeholder while I went through the cycle of rebuilding but never actually launching it more times than I care to admit. Well, flush with wisdom and renewed aspirations, here we are again.

## Technical details

If you're interested, some of this current iteration's underpinnings:

- It's built with the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator, the [base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) starter template, and some plugins for typographic niceties.
- The site design is certainly not novel, and inspired by countless others with a similar aesthetic. It will evolve, but I want to focus on writing and shipping (which I struggle with) and not fancy pixels (which I am prone to fiddling endlessly with).
- Pages are styled with hand-written vanilla CSS.
- The light/dark mode you have set on your device is respected. Maybe my eyes are getting old, but sites that blast a white background at me when I have dark mode on are rude.
- What typeface you see depends on your device, as I use [system fonts](https://modernfontstacks.com/) that are built into your operating system.
- This site does not track you or contain any analytics reporting at all. In fact, it doesn't use JavaScript anywhere in the pages you're viewing.
- If you're an RSS person, here's an [XML](/feed/feed.xml) or [JSON](/feed/feed.json) feed.
- The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dlimeb/dlimeb.github.io), which upon updating `main` automatically deploys to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting.
- At launch, this site had a [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) score of [4 100s](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-dieter-ca/vhrorl3zl3?form_factor=desktop). I have Netlify set up to alert me at build time if that dips too low.
- 0.00g of CO<sub>2</sub> is produced each time someone visits this site, as measured by [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/dieter-ca/). Of course it's actually a _non-zero_ amount, and this number may grow as the site does. But there's something about this as a unit of measure that's compelling. For example, there are many great typefaces I'd love to use here. But are they worth _carbon emissions_ to ship them to you?
